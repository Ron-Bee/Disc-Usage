The script starts by importing the shutil module for disk usage information and the sys module for system operations.
The check_disk_usage function takes three parameters: disk (the disk to check), min_absolute (the minimum absolute disk space required in bytes), and min_percent (the minimum percentage of free space required).
Inside the function, it uses shutil.disk_usage to get disk usage statistics, calculates the percentage of free space, and converts free space to gigabytes.
It then checks if either the percentage of free space or the gigabytes of free space is below the specified thresholds. If so, it returns False, indicating insufficient disk space.
The main part of the script calls check_disk_usage with the root directory ("/"), a minimum of 2 GB of absolute free space, and a minimum of 10% free space.
If check_disk_usage returns False, it prints an error message and exits with a status code of 1 (indicating an error).
If disk usage is within acceptable limits, it prints "Everything ok" and exits with a status code of 0 (indicating success).
This script is useful for performing disk space checks before running operations that require a certain amount of disk space.
